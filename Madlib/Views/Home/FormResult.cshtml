    <h1>Result Sample for a Form</h1>

    <p> One day @Model.PersonName  was feeling bored.@Model.PersonName had done the same things for @Model.NumberOfDays days in a row.  @Model.PersonName decided that the thing @Model.PersonName wanted to do more than anything was to learn how to fly. @Model.PersonName thought the best way to do this was to make wings and the test them by jumping off a roof. Sadly, @Model.PersonName fell and hurt his arm. The lesson he learned was that humans weren't meant to fly. </p>
